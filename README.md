# hello-world

This my first file in GitHub. I've worked with a lot of ladder logic and function block in PLC's. 
I've used a lot of Visual Basic and SQL I've dabbled a little bit with XML. 
I know C and C++ from college and am learning more C++ in a class. My goal is to refine my programming skills.

Attached is my first GitHub program called Hello World.
